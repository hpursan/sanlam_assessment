### Architectural Style:
The provided code follows a combination of architectural styles, mainly focusing on the Spring Boot framework's principles for building web applications. It employs a layered architecture, separating concerns into controller, service, repository layers.

1. **Controller Layer**: Handles incoming HTTP requests and delegates business logic to the service layer. It's responsible for handling HTTP request mappings and returning appropriate responses.

2. **Service Layer**: Contains business logic, acting as an intermediary between the controller and the repository layer. It performs tasks such as validation, processing, and orchestration of multiple operations.

3. **Repository Layer**: Manages data access operations, abstracting away the details of how data is stored or retrieved. It interacts with the database or any other data storage mechanism.

### SOLID Principles:
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class seems to have a single responsibility. For example, the `BankAccountController` handles HTTP requests, the `BankAccountService` handles business logic, and the `JdbcAccountRepository` handles data access operations.

- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: The code is open for extension (e.g., through the use of interfaces) but closed for modification. New features can be added by extending existing classes or implementing new ones without altering the existing code.

- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Not explicitly evident in the provided code, but it implies that derived classes (e.g., exception classes) should be substitutable for their base classes without affecting the program's correctness.

- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Interfaces (`AccountRepository`) are segregated to provide specific functionalities, ensuring that clients only depend on the methods they use.

- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules (`BankAccountService`) depend on abstractions (`AccountRepository`) rather than concrete implementations (`JdbcAccountRepository`), facilitating loose coupling and easier testing.

### Libraries Used:
1. **Spring Framework**: Used for dependency injection, inversion of control, and providing various abstractions to build enterprise-grade applications. Pro: Simplifies development, promotes modularity. Con: Learning curve, potential overhead.

2. **AWS SDK for Java v2**: Provides APIs to interact with AWS services such as SNS. Pro: Direct access to AWS services, asynchronous support. Con: Potential complexity, tight coupling with AWS.

3. **Lombok**: Reduces boilerplate code by generating getters, setters, constructors, etc., at compile-time. Pro: Increases code readability, reduces development time. Con: Requires developers to be familiar with Lombok annotations.

4. **Jackson**: Serializes/deserializes Java objects to/from JSON. Pro: Versatile, widely used, customizable. Con: Potential performance overhead for large objects.

5. **Logback**: A logging framework for Java applications. Pro: Flexible configuration, support for various logging levels, performance. Con: Configuration complexity for some advanced features.

6. **Spring Retry**: Provides declarative retry support for Spring applications. Pro: Simplifies retry logic, configurable backoff policies. Con: May add complexity if misused, potential performance impact.

### General Standards:
- **Java Version**: The codebase is written using Java 17.
- **Spring Boot**: Follows Spring Boot conventions and best practices for building web applications.
- **Exception Handling**: Uses custom exceptions for handling various error scenarios, improving code maintainability and readability.
- **Configuration**: Utilizes Spring Boot's `@Configuration` and `@Value` annotations for application configuration, promoting externalized configuration.
- **Logging**: Employs SLF4J with Logback for logging, adhering to industry-standard logging practices.
- **Dependency Management**: Manages dependencies using Maven, a widely-used build automation tool for Java projects.
- **Unit Testing**: Mentions the use of Mockito for unit testing, ensuring the reliability and robustness of the codebase.

### Summary:
The provided code represents a Spring Boot application for managing bank accounts. It consists of controllers for handling HTTP requests, services for implementing business logic, and repositories for data access operations. It integrates with AWS SNS for event publishing and employs a retry mechanism for resilience. The code adheres to SOLID principles, utilizes various libraries and frameworks, and follows general coding standards for Java and Spring Boot development.



Alternative tools with pro’s and con’s


1. **Micronaut or Quarkus** instead of Spring Boot:
    - *Micronaut*: A modern, JVM-based framework for building microservices and serverless applications. It offers fast startup time, minimal memory footprint, and compile-time dependency injection.
    - *Quarkus*: Another lightweight Java framework optimized for GraalVM and Kubernetes. It provides native compilation, reactive programming, and efficient resource utilization.

   **Why**: These alternatives offer similar functionalities to Spring Boot but with lower resource consumption and faster startup times, making them suitable for cloud-native and microservices-based architectures.

2. **AWS SDK v1 or AWS SDK for Java Async** instead of AWS SDK v2:
    - *AWS SDK v1*: The previous version of the AWS SDK for Java, which may offer different APIs and features.
    - *AWS SDK for Java Async*: Provides asynchronous APIs for interacting with AWS services, potentially improving performance and scalability in certain scenarios.

   **Why**: Depending on specific requirements or preferences, using an older version of the AWS SDK or asynchronous APIs may provide different trade-offs in terms of performance, features, or compatibility with existing codebases.

3. **Slf4j with Log4j 2** instead of Logback:
    - *Log4j 2*: A flexible and feature-rich logging framework with support for asynchronous logging, garbage-free logging, and custom log formats.

   **Why**: Log4j 2 offers similar capabilities to Logback but with additional features and performance improvements. It's a popular choice for logging in Java applications and provides a smooth migration path from Logback.

4. **JUnit 5 or TestNG** instead of JUnit 4:
    - *JUnit 5*: The latest version of the JUnit framework, offering new features such as parameterized tests, nested tests, and improved extension model.
    - *TestNG*: A testing framework inspired by JUnit but with additional features like test grouping, dependency management, and parallel test execution.

   **Why**: JUnit 5 and TestNG provide enhanced testing capabilities and better integration with modern Java development practices. They offer improvements over JUnit 4, including better support for parameterized tests and cleaner API design.

5. **Jakarta Persistence (JPA) or Spring Data JPA** instead of JDBC:
    - *Jakarta Persistence (JPA)*: A standardized API for object-relational mapping (ORM) in Java applications, providing a higher-level abstraction over database operations.
    - *Spring Data JPA*: A part of the Spring Data project that simplifies data access with JPA, offering repository abstractions and automatic query generation.

   **Why**: Using JPA or Spring Data JPA can streamline database operations, reduce boilerplate code, and improve maintainability compared to raw JDBC. They provide built-in support for transactions, caching, and entity management.

6. **Gson or Jackson Kotlin Module** instead of Jackson Core:
    - *Gson*: A lightweight JSON parsing library developed by Google, offering simplicity and ease of use.
    - *Jackson Kotlin Module*: An extension module for Jackson that provides Kotlin-specific features and improvements.

   **Why**: Depending on the project's requirements and preferences, Gson or the Jackson Kotlin Module may offer alternative solutions for JSON serialization and deserialization. They provide different trade-offs in terms of performance, features, and Kotlin compatibility.
